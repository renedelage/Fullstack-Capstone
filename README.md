These are the files from my final capstone project with Fullstack Academy. It was an analysis of a sample retail dataset, including figures for product sales, marketing campaign performace, and customer demographics.The 'clean_marketing_campaign.csv' file was used for SQL and Python analysis. Separate analaysis was performed in Excel, and that's the 'marketing_campaign_analysis.xlsx' file.
